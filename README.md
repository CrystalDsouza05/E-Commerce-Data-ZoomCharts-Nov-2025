🧭 Overview
------

This dashboard was developed as part of the **ZoomCharts November 2025 Mini Challenge**, focused on analyzing an **E-Commerce dataset** containing event-level sales, customer, and product information.  
The objective was to design an **interactive and insight-driven Power BI report** that highlights key business metrics such as revenue realization, order performance, product trends, and channel contributions.

------

The project uses three primary tables:

- 🧾 **Events:** Order, revenue, and transactional details  
- 🛒 **Products:** Product categories, pricing models, and subscription details
- 👥 **Customers:** Demographics, acquisition channels, and regional information  

A custom **Dates table** was created using DAX to support time intelligence, fiscal periods, and proper month-year sorting.


🧮 Key Measures (DAX)
------

The report includes a comprehensive measure layer to track performance and comparisons:

- 💰 Total Revenue USD  
- 🧾 Total Order Value USD  
- 🧍 Total Customers  
- 📦 Total Orders  
- 📊 Revenue Per Customer  
- 🔁 Month-over-Month (MoM %) and Year-over-Year (YoY %) growth  
- ⏪ Previous Month Revenue and Previous Month Orders  
- 📈 Total Quantity Ordered, Total Quantity Sold, and Total Products  
- 🧭 Progress and share metrics: Filtered % of Total Revenue, Remaining % of Total Revenue  
- ✅ Validation flags: Has Data, Has Data 2
